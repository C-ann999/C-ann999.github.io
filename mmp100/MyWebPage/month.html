		<h1>American Sign Language Mouth of the year</h1>

		
		<p>Before learning how to sign different months of the year in American Sign Language (ASL), itâ€™s important that you learn the American Sign Language alphabet first.

		The ASL signs for the months of the year are normally fingerspelled in abbreviation or in full (e.g. JAN for January or MARCH). Some people may fingerspell the months out fast or at normal speed. Hence, building your fingerspelling receptive skill is another thing that you have to practice while learning ASL.</p>
